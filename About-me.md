## ABOUT-ME 
I’m currently embarking on my AWS Restart journey, driven by a passion for cloud technology and a desire to build hands-on skills in Amazon Web Services. My interest in AWS stems from its transformative impact on businesses and the opportunity it provides to innovate and solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning new technical concepts, collaborating in team environments, and tackling challenging projects. Outside of tech, I’m enthusiastic about personal development, exploring new music, and staying active through sports and outdoor adventures.

Looking to the future, my long-term goal is to become a skilled software developer, specializing in cloud-native applications and scalable solutions. I aspire to contribute to impactful projects, continually expand my expertise in modern technologies, and eventually take on leadership roles where I can mentor others and drive innovation within the industry. Excited to leverage AWS knowledge to kickstart a rewarding career in software development!
